Welcome to my first created game - Rock-Paper-Scissors! This classic game is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
## Overview 🧭

This game was created in just one day, showcasing the simplicity and efficiency of the development process.

## Gameplay🎯
In Rock-Paper-Scissors, each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand:
- Rock: represented by a fist
- Paper: represented by an open hand
- Scissors: represented by a fist    with the index and middle fingers
 extended, forming a V
#  The rules are simple:
- Rock crushes Scissors
- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock

The game is typically played between two people, but here, you'll be playing against the computer.
